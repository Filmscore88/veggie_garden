Veggie Garden is a Sinatra CRUD app allowing the user to be able to login, and create a garden along with vegetables.
The user can delete, edit, and view the garden they created and select from a wide range of vegetables for their garden, and choose a planting_system to incorporate for their garden.

Usage:
clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun.
